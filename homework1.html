<h3><pre><b><i>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
All things were made by Him, and without Him was not made anything that was made.
The was in the beginning with God.
In Him was life and the life was the light of man.

And the light shines in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.
There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
The same came for a witness to bear witness of the Light that all men through him 
might believe.
He was not that Light but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 
That was the true Light which lights every man that comes into the world.

He was in the world and the world was made by him but the world knew Him not.
He came unto his own and his own received him not.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on his name.

Which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
men, but of God.
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us full of Grace and Truth. And we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.

John bore witness of him and cried saying, This was he of whom I spake, "He that comes
after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
And of his fulness have we all received and grace for grace.

For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bossom of the Father,
he has decalred him.

I am Standing on Your Rock
Though the Tides may Come
In have put my Trust
In only You
I am Standing Tall

I am Standing on Your Word
Dancing on the Waves
I am only Moved
By what You Say
So my Soul will Sing

You have Seen my Tears
You are Always here
You are Always here
All my Days
You have seen my Frame
Lord You know my Name
You know my Name
